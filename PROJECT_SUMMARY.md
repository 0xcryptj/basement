## 🔐 Security Measures

1. **Smart Contract:**
   - ReentrancyGuard on all payable functions
   - Input validation
   - Commit-reveal prevents front-running
   - Proper access control
   - Safe fund transfers

2. **Frontend:**
   - No private keys in code
   - localStorage only for non-sensitive data
   - Proper error handling
   - User confirmations for transactions

3. **Deployment:**
   - .env excluded from git
   - Private key warnings
   - Testnet-first approach
   - Verification instructions

## 🎮 Game Mechanics

### Coin Toss Flow

1. **Create Phase:**
   - Player 1 chooses Heads (0) or Tails (1)
   - Generates random salt
   - Creates commit: `keccak256(choice, salt)`
   - Sends stake + 5% fee
   - Game enters "Open" state

2. **Join Phase:**
   - Player 2 finds open game
   - Chooses Heads or Tails
   - Generates own salt
   - Creates commit
   - Sends matching stake + 5% fee
   - Game enters "Filled" state
   - 30-minute reveal timer starts

3. **Reveal Phase:**
   - Both players reveal choice + salt
   - Contract verifies commits
   - Game enters "Revealing" state
   - After both reveals → auto-settle

4. **Settlement:**
   - XOR logic determines winner:
     - Same choice (0⊕0 or 1⊕1) = 0 → Player 1 wins
     - Different (0⊕1 or 1⊕0) = 1 → Player 2 wins
   - Winner receives entire pot (both stakes)
   - Game enters "Settled" state

### Fee Structure

- **5% per player** (500 basis points)
- Deducted on stake entry
- Sent to house address immediately
- Example: 0.1 ETH stake = 0.105 ETH required (0.1 stake + 0.005 fee)
