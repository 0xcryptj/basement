### Wallet Persistence Logic

```javascript

localStorage.setItem('walletConnected', 'true');
localStorage.setItem('walletAddress', userAddress);

// On Page Load
const wasConnected = localStorage.getItem('walletConnected');
const savedAddress = localStorage.getItem('walletAddress');
// Auto-reconnect if wallet still has same account

// On Disconnect
localStorage.removeItem('walletConnected');
localStorage.removeItem('walletAddress');
```

### Event Listeners

```javascript
// Account changes
window.ethereum.on('accountsChanged', (accounts) => {
    // Handle account switch or disconnect
});

// Network changes
window.ethereum.on('chainChanged', () => {
    location.reload(); // Reload to ensure correct network
});
```

## User Benefits

✅ **No More Re-connecting** - Wallet stays connected across pages
✅ **Better Navigation** - Logo click returns home
✅ **Cleaner UI** - No fee mentions (will be in FAQ)
✅ **Consistent Design** - Homepage and arcade match perfectly
✅ **Auto-disconnect Detection** - Cleans up when user disconnects wallet
✅ **Network Switch Handling** - Auto-reload on network change

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Connect wallet on homepage
- [ ] Navigate to arcade - wallet should still be connected
- [ ] Navigate back to homepage - wallet should still be connected
- [ ] Click logo from arcade - should return to homepage
- [ ] Disconnect wallet in MetaMask - connection should clear
- [ ] Switch accounts - should update automatically
- [ ] Refresh page - wallet should auto-reconnect
- [ ] Check that no "5% fee" text appears in game UI

## Next Steps

2. **Disconnect Button** - Optional: Add manual disconnect button
3. **Network Detector** - Show warning if not on Base network

## Notes

- Fee is just hidden from UI per user request
- Wallet connection works with any Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase, etc.)
- localStorage persists across browser sessions
- Connection state syncs with wallet state
