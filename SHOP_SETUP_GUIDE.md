   - Copy the **UUID** from the URL (it looks like: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`)

### Step 2: Get Coinbase Developer Platform API Key

1. Go to [Coinbase Developer Portal](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com)
2. Create a new project or select existing project
3. Navigate to **API Keys**
4. Create a new API key for OnchainKit
5. Copy the API key (you won't be able to see it again!)

### Step 3: Get Reown Project ID

1. Go to [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy your **Project ID**

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the basement directory:

```bash
# Coinbase Commerce Product IDs
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_ARCADE_PASS=your_arcade_pass_uuid_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_VIP_MEMBERSHIP=your_vip_membership_uuid_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_GAME_CREDITS=your_game_credits_uuid_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_NFT_AVATAR=your_nft_avatar_uuid_here

# Coinbase Developer Platform API Key
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY=your_cdp_api_key_here

# Reown (WalletConnect) Project ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_WC_PROJECT_ID=your_walletconnect_project_id_here

# Optional: Disable Next.js telemetry
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:**
- Never commit `.env.local` to git (it's already in `.gitignore`)
- Keep your API keys secret
- Use different keys for development and production

### Step 5: Test the Integration

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/shop`

3. Connect your wallet (make sure you're on Base network)

4. Try purchasing a product:
   - Click **"Buy Now with Crypto"**
   - Your wallet popup will appear
   - Confirm the transaction
   - Watch the checkout status update in real-time

### Step 6: Verify Payments

1. Go to [Coinbase Commerce Dashboard](https://commerce.coinbase.com)
2. Navigate to **Payments**
3. You should see your test payment listed
4. Check payment status and blockchain confirmation

## üé® Customizing Products

### Update Product Information

Edit `app/shop/page.tsx` and modify the `SHOP_PRODUCTS` array:

```typescript
{
  id: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_YOUR_PRODUCT || 'demo-your-product',
  name: 'üéØ Your Product Name',
  description: 'Your product description',
  price: 0.005, // Price in ETH
  currency: 'ETH',
  image: '/assets/your-image.png',
  features: [
    'Feature 1',
    'Feature 2',
    'Feature 3',
  ],
  category: 'your-category'
}
```

### Add Product Images

1. Add your product images to `public/assets/`
2. Update the `image` field in product configuration
3. Recommended image size: `512x512px`
4. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, SVG

## üìä Setting Up Webhooks (Optional)

To automatically fulfill orders when payments are confirmed:

1. Go to [Coinbase Commerce Settings](https://commerce.coinbase.com/settings)
2. Navigate to **Webhook subscriptions**
3. Add your webhook endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/commerce`
4. Select events to subscribe to:
   - `charge:created`
   - `charge:confirmed`
   - `charge:failed`
5. Copy the webhook secret

### Create Webhook Handler

Create `app/api/webhooks/commerce/route.ts`:

```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const payload = await request.json();
  
  // Verify webhook signature
  // Process payment
  // Fulfill order
  
  return NextResponse.json({ received: true });
}
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- ‚úÖ Use `.env.local` for local development
- ‚úÖ Use platform environment variables for production (Vercel, etc.)
- ‚ùå Never commit API keys to git
- ‚ùå Never expose API keys in client-side code

### Smart Wallets
The integration uses Coinbase Smart Wallets for enhanced security:
- Gas sponsorship capabilities
- Better UX with batched transactions
- Enhanced security features

## üåê Production Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
   - Add all `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables
   - Deploy!

### Update Configuration

In production, update `src/app/config.ts`:

```typescript
export const NEXT_PUBLIC_URL = 'https://your-production-domain.com';
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Wallet Not Connecting
**Solution:**
- Make sure you're on Base network (Chain ID: 8453)

- Update wallet extension to latest version

### "Product Not Configured" Error
**Solution:**
