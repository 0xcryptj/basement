```bash
# Navigate to chain directory
cd chain

# Install dependencies (if not done)

# Start a local web server
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve
```

Open: http://localhost:8000/public/arcade/luckyblock.html

await luckyBlock.setEntryFee(ethers.parseEther("0.1")); // 0.1 ETH
```

```

Then redeploy.
