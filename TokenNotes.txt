The Arcade + Rake Model: PvP gaming for real money (ETH/USDC) with a 5% rake is solid and proven. It's straightforward, generates consistent revenue, and players understand it. This could be your primary value driver.
Multi-utility Token: Requiring token burns to create IRC channels gives your token real utility beyond speculation, which is smart.
Concerns About the Tokenomics
The 10% wallet cap: This is tricky. While it prevents whale dominance, it can:

Make your token less attractive to larger investors
Create liquidity issues on DEXs
Be gameable (someone creates multiple wallets)
Complicate CEX listings if you pursue them later

"Value increase through burning": Here's the reality check - burning tokens reduces supply, but it doesn't automatically increase value. Value comes from demand. You need to ask: Why would people want to buy your token in the first place?
The Core Question
Right now, the only demand driver for your token is: "People need it to create IRC channels." Is that enough? Consider:

How often will people create channels?
How much will 5 tokens cost?
Will people just buy exactly what they need and immediately burn it (creating no sustained demand)?

Suggestions to Strengthen This

Add more utility: Premium features in the arcade, reduced rake for token holders, access to exclusive tournaments, forum badges/privileges
Reconsider the wallet cap: Maybe use it initially for fair launch, but phase it out, or make it higher (25-30%)
Revenue sharing: Instead of just burning, consider using part of your 5% arcade rake to buy back and burn tokens - this creates buy pressure from real revenue
Staking rewards: Let people stake tokens to earn a portion of platform fees

What's your target user base, and how do you plan to drive initial adoption? That might help refine the tokenomics further.RetryJI need you to help me create a strategy for the tokenomics of this project So I can profit and give my token value. things youd do if you were me to ensure as much success as possibleEditAlright, let me design a tokenomics strategy that maximizes both your profit AND creates genuine token value. I'll approach this like I'm launching it myself.
Core Tokenomics Structure
Token Name: Let's call it ARCADE for this example
Total Supply: 100,000,000 tokens (adjust based on your preference)
Supply Allocation

40% - Liquidity Pool (locked): Creates initial trading capability
20% - Treasury (vested over 36 months): Your long-term incentive alignment
15% - Community Rewards (24-month emission): Player incentives, tournaments
10% - Team/Advisors (12-month cliff, 24-month vest): If you have partners
10% - Initial Development (6-month cliff): Your immediate runway
5% - Marketing/Partnerships (unlocked): Growth initiatives

Revenue Streams & Token Value Drivers
1. The Arcade Rake System (Your Primary Revenue)

5% rake on all PvP matches
Split it strategically:

2% → Your profit (ETH/USDC to your wallet)
2% → Buyback & Burn mechanism (creates buy pressure)
1% → Staking rewards pool (distributed to token stakers)



Why this works: The buyback creates constant demand for your token using real revenue. Players see deflationary pressure from actual usage, not just hype.
2. Token Utility Layers (Demand Drivers)
Tier 1 - Basic Access

Burn 5 tokens to create IRC channel (your original idea)
Burn 3 tokens to create forum thread in premium sections
Burn 1 token to highlight forum posts

Tier 2 - Premium Features

Hold 1,000 tokens: Reduce arcade rake to 4%
Hold 5,000 tokens: Reduce rake to 3%, custom avatar/badge
Hold 10,000 tokens: Reduce rake to 2.5%, access to whale-only tournaments

Tier 3 - Governance

Token holders vote on: new games added, rake % adjustments, tournament prize pools
Major decisions require token locking (30-90 days) to vote

Why this works: Creates both burn mechanics AND holding incentives. Players must choose between burning for features or holding for benefits.
3. The Staking Mechanism

Players stake tokens for 30/60/90 day periods
Earn from the 1% rake pool + bonus tokens from Treasury
Early unstaking = 10% penalty (half burned, half to staking pool)
APY: 15-30% depending on lock period

Why this works: Removes tokens from circulation, reduces sell pressure, rewards loyal users.
4. Tournament & Gamification

Weekly/Monthly tournaments with token prizes from Treasury
Leaderboards where top players earn token airdrops
Achievement NFTs that require token burns to mint
"Season passes" (burn tokens to unlock exclusive game modes for 3 months)

Why this works: Creates recurring demand and burns while driving engagement.
The Wallet Cap Decision
My recommendation: DON'T do the 10% wallet cap. Here's why:
Instead, implement:

Anti-whale launch: Max buy 0.5% of supply in first 24 hours, 1% in first week
Progressive transfer tax early on: 5% tax on sells in first month (decreases weekly), split between LP and burns
After month 1: No restrictions

Why this works: Protects against snipers at launch but doesn't hamper long-term liquidity or growth.
Launch Strategy for Maximum Success
Phase 1: Pre-Launch (Month -2 to 0)

Build a small MVP of the arcade (even 1-2 simple games)
Closed beta with 100-500 testers using testnet
Build community on Discord/Twitter with play-to-earn expectations
Create FOMO: "Founding Members" who test get bonus token airdrop
Lock liquidity visibly on-chain before launch

Phase 2: Launch (Month 0-3)

Fair launch on Base DEX (no presale = more trust)
Launch with 2-3 polished games immediately playable
Start with LOW entry barriers (games cost $1-5 to play)
Heavy marketing on Base ecosystem channels
Launch staking immediately
First tournament Week 2 with $5K prize pool (from your allocation)

Phase 3: Growth (Month 3-12)

Add new game monthly based on community votes
Begin partnership with other Base projects (shared tournaments)
Implement leaderboard NFTs
Launch mobile-friendly version
Start buyback & burn reports weekly (transparency builds trust)

Your Profit Strategy
Year 1 Target: Let's say you get 1,000 daily active users averaging $20/day in bets

Daily volume: $20,000
Your 2% profit cut: $400/day = $146K/year
(The other 2% goes to buyback, 1% to stakers)

Year 2-3: Scale to 10K users

Same math: $1.46M/year in profit
Your vested tokens from Treasury also unlock
Token price likely 10-50x from launch if you execute well

Risk Mitigation

Liquidity locked: Use Unilock or similar for 12+ months
Audit your contracts: Critical for trust (~$10-20K investment)
Transparent wallet: Make your dev wallet public
Regular burns: Weekly burn events with announcements
Revenue dashboard: Public page showing rake collected, burns executed, staking rewards paid

Success Metrics to Track

Daily Active Users (DAU)
Total Value Locked in games
Token burn rate vs. emission rate
Staking ratio (% of supply staked)
User retention (7-day, 30-day)

The Bottom Line
What makes this work:

Real revenue from the arcade (not just token speculation)
Multiple burn mechanisms (IRC, forums, achievements, tournaments)
Holding incentives (staking, rake reduction, governance)
Constant buy pressure from revenue-based buybacks
Community alignment (rewards, tournaments, governance)

You profit from the rake directly (2%) PLUS your token allocation appreciates if you execute well. The token has value because it: reduces costs, provides access, earns yield, and deflates over time.
The key: Launch with working products, not promises. One good PvP game that's fun and works is worth 10 whitepapers.
