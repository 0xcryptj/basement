# 🎰 Lucky Block - Custom Betting Update

## ✅ What Changed

### **Players Can Now Bet ANY Amount of ETH!**

Previously, players were limited to preset betting increments. Now they have complete freedom to bet exactly what they want.

---

## 🎯 New Features

### 1. **Custom Input Field**
- ✨ **Direct input box** where players can type any ETH amount
- Minimum: **0.0001 ETH** (~$0.20)
- Maximum: **Unlimited** (player's choice)
- Real-time USD conversion display

### 2. **Quick Increment Buttons** (Still Available)
For convenience, players can still use buttons:
- **+0.001 ETH** (~$2)
- **+0.005 ETH** (~$10)
- **+0.01 ETH** (~$20)
- **+0.05 ETH** (~$100)
- **+0.1 ETH** (~$200)
- **Clear** (reset to 0.001 ETH)

### 3. **Weighted Probability System**
- 🎲 **Higher bets = Higher chance to win**
- Win probability is proportional to bet size
- Example: Bet 0.1 ETH vs others betting 0.001 ETH = 100x better odds
- Completely fair and transparent

---

## 💡 How It Works

### **Betting System**

**Example Round:**
| Player | Bet Amount | Win Chance |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Player 1 | 0.001 ETH | 1% |
| Player 2 | 0.01 ETH | 10% |
| Player 3 | 0.05 ETH | 50% |
| Player 4 | 0.039 ETH | 39% |
| **Total** | **0.1 ETH** | **100%** |

**Winner:** Selected based on weighted random selection
**Payout:** Winner gets 95% of total pot (0.095 ETH)
**House Fee:** 5% (0.005 ETH)

### **Weighted Selection Algorithm**

```javascript
// Smart contract selects winner fairly
1. Calculate total of all bets
2. Generate random number between 0 and total
3. Iterate through players, adding their bet to cumulative sum
4. First player whose cumulative exceeds random number = WINNER!
```

This is **provably fair** and verifiable on-chain!

## 🎨 UI Improvements

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### **Frontend (luckyblock.html)**

#### New Input Field
```html
<input

    min="0.0001"

- `animateWinnerSelection()` - Uses weighted random selection

### **Smart Contract (LuckyBlock.sol)**

#### Updated Round Structure
```solidity
struct Round {
    uint256 id;
    address payable[] players;
    uint256[] bets;         // NEW: Array of bet amounts
    uint256 pot;
    // ... other fields
}
```

#### Updated Entry Function
```solidity
function enterRound(address referrer) external payable {
    require(msg.value > 0, "Bet must be > 0");  // ANY amount!
    // ... stores bet amount in array
}
```

#### Weighted Winner Selection
```solidity
function _drawWinner() internal {
    // Calculate cumulative bet amounts
    uint256 randomNumber = randomSeed % totalPot;
    
    // Find winner using weighted probability
    for (uint i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
        cumulative += bets[i];
        if (randomNumber < cumulative) {
            winnerIndex = i;
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

## 🎯 Strategic Considerations

### **Risk vs Reward**

**Small Bets:**
- ✅ Low risk
- ✅ High ROI if win
- ❌ Low win probability

**Large Bets:**
- ✅ High win probability  
- ✅ Consistent wins
- ❌ Lower ROI
- ❌ Higher risk amount

### **Game Theory**

Players must balance:
1. **Bet size** - How much to risk
2. **Pot size** - Total amount in play
3. **Competition** - Other players' bets
4. **Risk tolerance** - Comfort with loss

**Smart Strategy:** Bet proportionally to your confidence and bankroll!

## 🚀 Testing Instructions

### **1. Start Dev Server**
```powershell
cd public/arcade
npm run dev
```

### **2. Open Lucky Block**
🎰 http://localhost:5173/luckyblock.html

### **3. Test Custom Betting**

**Try these amounts:**
```
Type:  0.0001  (minimum)
Type:  0.00567 (odd amount)
Type:  0.1     (nice round number)
Type:  1.234   (large odd amount)
Type:  10      (whale bet)
```

**Use increment buttons:**
```
Start: 0.001 ETH
Click +0.01 → Now 0.011 ETH
Click +0.05 → Now 0.061 ETH
Click Clear → Reset to 0.001 ETH
```

### **4. Test Weighted Odds**

**Scenario:**
1. Player 1 enters with 0.001 ETH (you)
2. Player 2 enters with 0.099 ETH (AI)
3. View circular wheel - P2 should have 99% of the wheel
4. Winner announcement should favor P2 (99% of time)
