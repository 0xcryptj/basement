## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Token Verification Flow
```typescript
1. User attempts to create channel/thread/post
2. API extracts wallet address from request
3. Calls Base network RPC via viem
4. Checks ERC-20 balanceOf(address)
5. Compares balance vs. minimum requirement
6. Returns 403 with helpful error if insufficient
7. Proceeds with action if sufficient balance
```

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "error": "Insufficient token balance",
  "message": "You need at least 0.001000 $BASEMENT tokens to create a channel. Your balance: 0.000000",
  "required": "0.001000",
  "balance": "0.000000",
  "tokenAddress": "0xcf4abb42b4b47eb242eabab5c9a9913bcad9ca23",
  "buyLinks": {
    "dexScreener": "https://dexscreener.com/base/...",
    "geckoterminal": "https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/pools/..."
  }
}
```
