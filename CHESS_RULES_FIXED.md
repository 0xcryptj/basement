## ‚úÖ **ALL CHESS RULE VIOLATIONS RESOLVED**

**Status:** ‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY  
**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Issues Fixed:** All major chess rule violations

---

## üéØ **ISSUES IDENTIFIED & FIXED**

### **1. ‚ùå Check Not Being Honored** ‚Üí **‚úÖ FIXED**

**Problem:** Game didn't detect when king was under attack  
**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive check detection system

**New Features:**
```javascript
// Check Detection
function isInCheck(kingColor) {
    - Finds king position on board
    - Checks if any opponent piece can attack king
    - Uses move validation to test attacks
    - Returns true if king is under threat
}

// Check Announcement
if (isInCheck(nextPlayer)) {
    addChatMessage('SYSTEM', `${nextPlayer.toUpperCase()} is in check!`);
}
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Players are now warned when in check

---

### **2. ‚ùå Game Not Ending When King Captured** ‚Üí **‚úÖ FIXED**

**Problem:** Game continued even after king was captured  
**Solution:** Immediate game termination on king capture

**New Logic:**
```javascript
// King Capture Detection
if (capturedPiece && (capturedPiece === '‚ôî' || capturedPiece === '‚ôö')) {
    const winner = gameState.currentPlayer;
    addChatMessage('SYSTEM', `${gameState.currentPlayer} captured the king! ${winner.toUpperCase()} wins!`);
    endGame(winner);
    return; // Game ends immediately
}
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Game ends instantly when king is captured

---

### **3. ‚ùå Moves Putting Own King in Check Allowed** ‚Üí **‚úÖ FIXED**

**Problem:** Players could make moves that put their own king in check  
**Solution:** Enhanced move validation with check prevention

**New Validation:**
```javascript
function isValidMove(fromRow, fromCol, toRow, toCol) {
    // ... basic move validation ...
    
    // Check if move would put own king in check
    const playerColor = isWhite ? 'white' : 'black';
    
    // Simulate the move
    gameState.board[toRow][toCol] = movingPiece;
    gameState.board[fromRow][fromCol] = null;
    
    // Check if this puts own king in check
    const wouldBeInCheck = isInCheck(playerColor);
    
    // Restore board
    gameState.board[fromRow][fromCol] = movingPiece;
    gameState.board[toRow][toCol] = originalPiece;
    
    // If would put king in check, move is invalid
    if (wouldBeInCheck) return false;
    
    return true;
}
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Players cannot make moves that put their king in check

---

### **4. ‚ùå No Checkmate Detection** ‚Üí **‚úÖ FIXED**

**Problem:** Game didn't detect checkmate situations  
**Solution:** Comprehensive checkmate detection system

**New Logic:**
```javascript
function isCheckmate(playerColor) {
    // Must be in check to be checkmate
    if (!isInCheck(playerColor)) return false;
    
    // Check if any move can get out of check
    for (let fromRow = 0; fromRow < 8; fromRow++) {
        for (let fromCol = 0; fromCol < 8; fromCol++) {
            const piece = gameState.board[fromRow][fromCol];
            if (piece && playerPieces.includes(piece)) {
                for (let toRow = 0; toRow < 8; toRow++) {
                    for (let toCol = 0; toCol < 8; toCol++) {
                        if (isValidMove(fromRow, fromCol, toRow, toCol)) {
                            // Simulate move and check if it gets out of check
                            // ... simulation logic ...
                            if (!stillInCheck) {
                                return false; // Found escape move
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return true; // No moves can escape check
}
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Game properly detects and announces checkmate

---

### **5. ‚ùå "Chess Wager" Name** ‚Üí **‚úÖ FIXED**
