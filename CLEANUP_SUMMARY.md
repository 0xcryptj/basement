## üîß Remaining Tasks

### 1. **Chess Smart Contract Logic** üî®
**Status:** Smart contract exists, needs deployment

**What's Needed:**
- Deploy chess contract to Base network
- Update chess.html with contract address
- Test wager system
- Verify moves are recorded on-chain

**Files to Update:**
- `chain/contracts/` - Chess contract (if not deployed)
- `public/arcade/chess.html` - Add contract integration
- Similar to how luckyblock.html integrates with its contract

**Priority:** Medium

---

### 2. **Dynamic Responsive Sizing** üî®  
**Status:** Partially implemented, needs improvements

**Current Issues:**
- Some components use fixed pixel sizes
- Aspect ratios not always maintained
- Font sizes need better scaling

**What's Needed:**

#### A. Convert Fixed Sizes to Responsive:
```css
/* Before */
.game-tile {
    width: 300px;
    height: 400px;
}

/* After */
.game-tile {
    width: clamp(250px, 30vw, 400px);
    aspect-ratio: 3/4;
}
```

#### B. Font Size Scaling:
```css
/* Use clamp() for better scaling */
h1 {
    font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 5vw, 3rem);
}
```

#### C. Container Queries (Modern Approach):
```css
@container (min-width: 400px) {
    .game-tile {
        grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
    }
}
```

**Files to Update:**
- `public/style.css` - Global styles
- `public/arcade/arcade.css` - Arcade styles  
- `app/shop/page.tsx` - Shop component
- `components/shop/ProductCard.tsx` - Product cards

**Priority:** High

---

### 3. **Streamline Profile Creation** üî®
**Status:** Needs UX improvements

**Current Issues:**
- Profile modal appears immediately on connect
- Too many options might be confusing
- Could be more streamlined

**Improvements Needed:**

#### A. Simplify Flow:
1. Connect wallet first (no modal)
2. Let users explore site
3. Show profile setup only when needed (posting, gaming)
4. Add "Complete Profile" banner/reminder

#### B. Better Defaults:
- Auto-generate username from wallet address
- Allow quick skip with default profile
- Save preferences (don't ask again)

#### C. Professional Touch:
- Add avatars/profile pictures
- Integration with ENS names
- Wallet-based reputation system

**Files to Update:**
- `public/script.js` - Profile modal logic
- `public/index.html` - Profile setup dialog
- Add localStorage for "don't show again"

**Priority:** Medium

---

### 4. **Verify Wallet Connectors** üî®
**Status:** Recently integrated AppKit, needs testing

**What to Test:**

#### A. AppKit Integration:
- ‚úÖ Installed `@reown/appkit`  
- ‚úÖ Configured in `app/providers.tsx`
- ‚úÖ Added `<appkit-button />` component

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Test MetaMask connection
- [ ] Test Coinbase Wallet connection
- [ ] Test WalletConnect (mobile wallets)
- [ ] Verify network switching to Base
- [ ] Test wallet persistence across page refreshes
- [ ] Verify transactions work after connection
- [ ] Test disconnect and reconnect

#### B. Shop Payment Integration:
- [ ] Connect wallet in `/shop`
- [ ] Try purchasing a product
- [ ] Verify OnchainKit checkout works
- [ ] Test transaction confirmation flow

#### C. Game Integration:
- [ ] Connect wallet in luckyblock.html
- [ ] Verify contract interaction
- [ ] Test entering a round
- [ ] Confirm transaction signing works

**Environment Variables Required:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_WC_PROJECT_ID=your_reown_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

**Files to Check:**
- `config/index.tsx` - Wagmi adapter config
- `app/providers.tsx` - AppKit setup
- `components/WalletConnectButton.tsx` - Button component

**Priority:** High (Critical for functionality)

### 5. **Code Cleanup** üî®
**Status:** Ongoing maintenance

**Areas to Clean:**

#### A. Remove Unused Code:
- Old wallet connection code (if AppKit replaces it)
- Commented out sections
- Duplicate functions
- Unused imports

#### B. Consolidate Styles:
- Merge duplicate CSS rules
- Remove `!important` where possible
- Organize by component
- Use CSS variables for colors

#### C. Improve Code Organization:
```
components/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wallet/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WalletConnectButton.tsx
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ WalletStatus.tsx
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shop/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProductCard.tsx
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ProductGrid.tsx
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ arcade/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GameCard.tsx
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ GameGrid.tsx
```

#### D. Add TypeScript Types:
- Define interfaces for game data
- Type API responses
- Type contract interactions

#### E. Performance Optimization:
- Lazy load images
- Code splitting for routes
- Minimize bundle size
- Use React.memo for expensive components

**Files to Review:**
- All `.tsx` and `.ts` files
- All CSS files
- Remove console.logs in production

**Priority:** Medium (Ongoing)
